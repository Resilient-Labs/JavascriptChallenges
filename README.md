Javascript Challenges for Resilient Lab Team

#Javascript Challenge #1: NY vs Boston T-Shirt
Use JS to tell me how much more is a New York shirt that is 30$ (with an 8% sales tax) versus a Boston t shirt that is 30$ (with a 7% sales tax). Then create a function that takes in a number (a price) as a parameter and returns the price after taxes.

#Javascript Challenge #2: Madlib
Create a function that takes in a data from a user and stores it locally then outputs that data into the html page underneath the form buttons.

Tests: 
	
	Storing data from input forms locally.
	
	Writing functions
	
	Using global and local variables
	
	Appending/Concatenating Strings in a variable

Madlib Example:	

Damn, [#User]. You just completed a [#Adjective] madlib that I created using Javascript. If I could, I would have a [#Singer] song playing for you right now, because I know you love their music but instead I will predict your future. Later today, you will [#PlansForLater]. See! Yo, that’s crazy right? I also know your best friend is named: [#BestFriend]. I’m done now, hit up resilientcoders.org for info on how I can predict your future some more. Hint: ask for their motto.
